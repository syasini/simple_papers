In particular, we demonstrate how spectral measurements of the low multipoles can be used to separate the motion-induced dipole of the CMB from a possible intrinsic dipole component. In a moving frame, the leakage of an intrinsic dipole moment into the CMB monopole and quadrupole induces spectral distortions with distinct frequency functions that respectively peak at 337 GHz and 276 GHz. The leakage into the quadrupole moment also induces a geometrical distortion to the spatial morphology of this mode. The combination of these effects can be used to lift the degeneracy between the motion-induced dipole and any intrinsic dipole that the CMB might possess. Assuming the current peculiar velocity measurements, the leakage of an intrinsic dipole with an amplitude of $\\Delta T = 30\\mu$K into the monopole and quadrupole moments will be detectable by a _PIXIE_\u2013like experiment at $\\sim 40$ nK (2.5$\\sigma$) and $\\sim 130$ nK (11$\\sigma$) level at their respective peak frequencies.\n\n*Introduction.* The measurements of the COBE/FIRAS instrument show that the intensity of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) has an almost perfect blackbody spectrum [1]. Even though in a frame moving with respect to the CMB the observed intensity is effectively a blackbody in every direction, the intensity harmonic multipoles in this frame generally contain frequency spectral distortions. These distortions are a result of the leakage of the nearby multipoles into each other due to the aberration and Doppler effects [2\u20136]. The most prominent motion-induced leakage component is that of the monopole into the dipole (i.e. kinematic dipole). The kinematic dipole has a frequency dependence identical to a differential blackbody spectrum which makes it degenerate with any intrinsic (or non-kinematic) dipole that the CMB might possess. Current modeling of the CMB dipole only includes the leakage of the monopole, but ignores any intrinsic dipole component as well as other kinematic corrections to this mode (e.g. the leakage of the quadrupole). Here we present an accurate description of the frequency spectrum of the low multipoles of CMB and show how the kinematic (motion-induced) corrections to these modes can be used by the next generation of CMB surveys to lift the dipole degeneracy.\n\nA kinematic dipole is not the only observational con-\nsequence of our motion with respect to the CMB. The\nmotion-induced leakage of the intensity multipoles into\neach other causes a _boost coupling_ between the nearby\nmultipoles. Measuring this boost coupling in a wide\nrange of harmonic modes can actually lead to an inde-\npendent measure of the peculiar velocity of an observer\n\nwith respect to the CMB [7\u201310]. In the CMB rest frame,\nall motion-induced effects (including the kinematic dipole\nand the boost coupling) vanish; however, there is no com-\npelling reason for us to believe that the intrinsic dipole\nmoment of the CMB in this frame is precisely zero.\n\nIt has been shown that in a flat \u039bCDM universe with\nadiabatic initial perturbations, the intrinsic dipole of the\nCMB is strongly suppressed [11, 12]. For this reason,\nthe intrinsic dipole of the CMB is usually either ignored\nor set to zero, and the observed dipole of the CMB is\ninterpreted entirely as a kinematic effect. This results\nin a peculiar velocity of $\\beta \\equiv v/c = 0.00123$ in the di-\nrection $\\hat{\\beta} = (264^\\circ, 48^\\circ)$ in galactic coordinates [13]. If\nthe observed dipole moment only has a kinematic ori-\ngin, it can be used to define a natural rest frame for\nCMB (namely, the frame in which the whole dipole van-\nishes). However, unintended subtraction of an existent\nnon-kinematic dipole in this process will result in ob-\ntaining an incorrect CMB rest frame. This can in turn\nlead to unexpected anomalies, such as the observed power\nand parity asymmetries in the CMB [14, 15] and the mis-\nmatch between the CMB rest frame and the matter rest\nframe [16\u201319]. Studying the angular variance of the Hubble\nparameter over different redshifts (in the CMB dipole-\ninferred frame) also indicates the presence of a non-\nkinematic dipole component in the CMB [20, 21]. Fur-\nthermore, since isocurvature initial perturbations, and\nmulti-field inflationary scenarios typically invoke a non-\nnegligible intrinsic dipole moment, a detection of this\ncomponent could have important implications for pre-\nrecombination physics [22\u201326].\n\nRecently the Planck team has obtained an independent\nvalue for the peculiar velocity of the solar system using\nthe boost coupling of the CMB multipoles. Their result\n$\\beta = 0.00128 \\pm 0.00026$ (stat.) $\\pm 0.00038$ (syst.) [7] is consis-\n\ntent with the kinematic interpretation of the dipole and\nshows that most of the dipole that we observe is induced\nby our peculiar motion. However, the error bars still al-\nlow for a non-kinematic dipole component that remains\nto be measured.\n\nIn this letter we show how the kinematic and non-\nkinematic dipoles can be separated by measuring the\nmotion-induced spectral distortions in the observed low\nmultipoles of the CMB in our local frame. Future mi-\ncrowave surveys, such as _PIXIE_ with a sensitivity of\n5 Jy/sr, will be able to measure these effects with high\nprecision.\n\n*Lorentz boosting the CMB.* We define the rest frame of\nthe CMB as the frame in which its kinematic dipole (the\nleakage of the monopole into the dipole) vanishes.\\textsuperscript{1} We\nstill allow the CMB to have a non-kinematic dipole in this\nframe. Then we argue that the full frequency spectrum of\nthe low intensity multipoles in the boosted frame can be\nexploited to separate the intrinsic dipole from the kine-\nmatic part induced by a boost. We assume that the CMB\nfrequency spectrum in its rest frame can be described as\na pure blackbody by neglecting any pre-recombination\nand secondary $\\mu$- and $y$-distortions (see Fig. 12 in [27],\nalso [28]).

The leakage into the quadrupole moment also induces a geometrical distortion to the spatial morphology of this mode. The combination of these effects can be used to lift the degeneracy between the motion-induced dipole and any intrinsic dipole that the CMB might possess. Assuming the current peculiar velocity measurements, the leakage of an intrinsic dipole with an amplitude of $\\Delta T = 30\\mu$K into the monopole and quadrupole moments will be detectable by a _PIXIE_\u2013like experiment at $\\sim 40$ nK (2.5$\\sigma$) and $\\sim 130$ nK (11$\\sigma$) level at their respective peak frequencies.\n\n*Introduction.* The measurements of the COBE/FIRAS instrument show that the intensity of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) has an almost perfect blackbody spectrum [1]. Even though in a frame moving with respect to the CMB the observed intensity is effectively a blackbody in every direction, the intensity harmonic multipoles in this frame generally contain frequency spectral distortions. These distortions are a result of the leakage of the nearby multipoles into each other due to the aberration and Doppler effects [2\u20136]. The most prominent motion-induced leakage component is that of the monopole into the dipole (i.e. kinematic dipole). The kinematic dipole has a frequency dependence identical to a differential blackbody spectrum which makes it degenerate with any intrinsic (or non-kinematic) dipole that the CMB might possess. Current modeling of the CMB dipole only includes the leakage of the monopole, but ignores any intrinsic dipole component as well as other kinematic corrections to this mode (e.g. the leakage of the quadrupole). Here we present an accurate description of the frequency spectrum of the low multipoles of CMB and show how the kinematic (motion-induced) corrections to these modes can be used by the next generation of CMB surveys to lift the dipole degeneracy.\n\nA kinematic dipole is not the only observational con-\nsequence of our motion with respect to the CMB. The\nmotion-induced leakage of the intensity multipoles into\neach other causes a _boost coupling_ between the nearby\nmultipoles. Measuring this boost coupling in a wide\nrange of harmonic modes can actually lead to an inde-\npendent measure of the peculiar velocity of an observer\n\nwith respect to the CMB [7\u201310]. In the CMB rest frame,\nall motion-induced effects (including the kinematic dipole\nand the boost coupling) vanish; however, there is no com-\npelling reason for us to believe that the intrinsic dipole\nmoment of the CMB in this frame is precisely zero.\n\nIt has been shown that in a flat \u039bCDM universe with\nadiabatic initial perturbations, the intrinsic dipole of the\nCMB is strongly suppressed [11, 12]. For this reason,\nthe intrinsic dipole of the CMB is usually either ignored\nor set to zero, and the observed dipole of the CMB is\ninterpreted entirely as a kinematic effect. This results\nin a peculiar velocity of $\\beta \\equiv v/c = 0.00123$ in the di-\nrection $\\hat{\\beta} = (264^\\circ, 48^\\circ)$ in galactic coordinates [13]. If\nthe observed dipole moment only has a kinematic ori-\ngin, it can be used to define a natural rest frame for\nCMB (namely, the frame in which the whole dipole van-\nishes).

This can in turn\nlead to unexpected anomalies, such as the observed power\nand parity asymmetries in the CMB [14, 15] and the mis-\nmatch between the CMB rest frame and the matter rest\nframe [16\u201319]. Studying the angular variance of the Hubble\nparameter over different redshifts (in the CMB dipole-\ninferred frame) also indicates the presence of a non-\nkinematic dipole component in the CMB [20, 21].

In particular, we demonstrate how spectral measurements of the low multipoles can be used to separate the motion-induced dipole of the CMB from a possible intrinsic dipole component. In a moving frame, the leakage of an intrinsic dipole moment into the CMB monopole and quadrupole induces spectral distortions with distinct frequency functions that respectively peak at 337 GHz and 276 GHz.

Even though in a frame moving with respect to the CMB the observed intensity is effectively a blackbody in every direction, the intensity harmonic multipoles in this frame generally contain frequency spectral distortions. These distortions are a result of the leakage of the nearby multipoles into each other due to the aberration and Doppler effects [2\u20136]. The most prominent motion-induced leakage component is that of the monopole into the dipole (i.e. kinematic dipole). The kinematic dipole has a frequency dependence identical to a differential blackbody spectrum which makes it degenerate with any intrinsic (or non-kinematic) dipole that the CMB might possess. Current modeling of the CMB dipole only includes the leakage of the monopole, but ignores any intrinsic dipole component as well as other kinematic corrections to this mode (e.g. the leakage of the quadrupole). Here we present an accurate description of the frequency spectrum of the low multipoles of CMB and show how the kinematic (motion-induced) corrections to these modes can be used by the next generation of CMB surveys to lift the dipole degeneracy.\n\nA kinematic dipole is not the only observational con-\nsequence of our motion with respect to the CMB. The\nmotion-induced leakage of the intensity multipoles into\neach other causes a _boost coupling_ between the nearby\nmultipoles. Measuring this boost coupling in a wide\nrange of harmonic modes can actually lead to an inde-\npendent measure of the peculiar velocity of an observer\n\nwith respect to the CMB [7\u201310]. In the CMB rest frame,\nall motion-induced effects (including the kinematic dipole\nand the boost coupling) vanish; however, there is no com-\npelling reason for us to believe that the intrinsic dipole\nmoment of the CMB in this frame is precisely zero.\n\nIt has been shown that in a flat \u039bCDM universe with\nadiabatic initial perturbations, the intrinsic dipole of the\nCMB is strongly suppressed [11, 12]. For this reason,\nthe intrinsic dipole of the CMB is usually either ignored\nor set to zero, and the observed dipole of the CMB is\ninterpreted entirely as a kinematic effect. This results\nin a peculiar velocity of $\\beta \\equiv v/c = 0.00123$ in the di-\nrection $\\hat{\\beta} = (264^\\circ, 48^\\circ)$ in galactic coordinates [13].

In particular, we demonstrate how spectral measurements of the low multipoles can be used to separate the motion-induced dipole of the CMB from a possible intrinsic dipole component. In a moving frame, the leakage of an intrinsic dipole moment into the CMB monopole and quadrupole induces spectral distortions with distinct frequency functions that respectively peak at 337 GHz and 276 GHz. The leakage into the quadrupole moment also induces a geometrical distortion to the spatial morphology of this mode. The combination of these effects can be used to lift the degeneracy between the motion-induced dipole and any intrinsic dipole that the CMB might possess.

Even though in a frame moving with respect to the CMB the observed intensity is effectively a blackbody in every direction, the intensity harmonic multipoles in this frame generally contain frequency spectral distortions. These distortions are a result of the leakage of the nearby multipoles into each other due to the aberration and Doppler effects [2\u20136]. The most prominent motion-induced leakage component is that of the monopole into the dipole (i.e. kinematic dipole). The kinematic dipole has a frequency dependence identical to a differential blackbody spectrum which makes it degenerate with any intrinsic (or non-kinematic) dipole that the CMB might possess. Current modeling of the CMB dipole only includes the leakage of the monopole, but ignores any intrinsic dipole component as well as other kinematic corrections to this mode (e.g. the leakage of the quadrupole). Here we present an accurate description of the frequency spectrum of the low multipoles of CMB and show how the kinematic (motion-induced) corrections to these modes can be used by the next generation of CMB surveys to lift the dipole degeneracy.\n\nA kinematic dipole is not the only observational con-\nsequence of our motion with respect to the CMB. The\nmotion-induced leakage of the intensity multipoles into\neach other causes a _boost coupling_ between the nearby\nmultipoles. Measuring this boost coupling in a wide\nrange of harmonic modes can actually lead to an inde-\npendent measure of the peculiar velocity of an observer\n\nwith respect to the CMB [7\u201310]. In the CMB rest frame,\nall motion-induced effects (including the kinematic dipole\nand the boost coupling) vanish; however, there is no com-\npelling reason for us to believe that the intrinsic dipole\nmoment of the CMB in this frame is precisely zero.\n\nIt has been shown that in a flat \u039bCDM universe with\nadiabatic initial perturbations, the intrinsic dipole of the\nCMB is strongly suppressed [11, 12]. For this reason,\nthe intrinsic dipole of the CMB is usually either ignored\nor set to zero, and the observed dipole of the CMB is\ninterpreted entirely as a kinematic effect. This results\nin a peculiar velocity of $\\beta \\equiv v/c = 0.00123$ in the di-\nrection $\\hat{\\beta} = (264^\\circ, 48^\\circ)$ in galactic coordinates [13]. If\nthe observed dipole moment only has a kinematic ori-\ngin, it can be used to define a natural rest frame for\nCMB (namely, the frame in which the whole dipole van-\nishes). However, unintended subtraction of an existent\nnon-kinematic dipole in this process will result in ob-\ntaining an incorrect CMB rest frame. This can in turn\nlead to unexpected anomalies, such as the observed power\nand parity asymmetries in the CMB [14, 15] and the mis-\nmatch between the CMB rest frame and the matter rest\nframe [16\u201319]. Studying the angular variance of the Hubble\nparameter over different redshifts (in the CMB dipole-\ninferred frame) also indicates the presence of a non-\nkinematic dipole component in the CMB [20, 21]. Fur-\nthermore, since isocurvature initial perturbations, and\nmulti-field inflationary scenarios typically invoke a non-\nnegligible intrinsic dipole moment, a detection of this\ncomponent could have important implications for pre-\nrecombination physics [22\u201326].\n\nRecently the Planck team has obtained an independent\nvalue for the peculiar velocity of the solar system using\nthe boost coupling of the CMB multipoles.
