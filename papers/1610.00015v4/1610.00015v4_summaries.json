It's like how raindrops appear to hit your windshield at an angle when you're driving, even if they're falling straight down.\n  \n* The equations (4-7) show how the intensity of the CMB radiation gets transformed when you're moving relative to it. There are two main effects: Doppler shift (changing the frequency) and aberration (changing the apparent direction).\n\n* When you work through all this math (which would make most calculators sweat), you find that motion causes \"leakage\" between different multipoles - basically, patterns from one scale contaminate measurements at other scales.\n\n* The section specifically focuses on the \"boosted dipole\" problem - showing that what we observe as the CMB dipole is actually a mix of the intrinsic cosmic dipole and effects from our own motion, making them hard to separate.\n\nSo basically, this section is laying out the mathematical framework for understanding how our galaxy's motion through space affects our measurements of the cosmic microwave background's patterns, particularly the dipole component."
