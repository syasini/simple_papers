    "1-abstract": "# Abstract\n\n*Time to meet the star of the show \u2014 chain-of-thought prompting!*\n\n\u2022 This research shows that when large language models \"show their work\" by generating intermediate reasoning steps (called a \"chain of thought\"), they get way better at solving complex problems. It's like the difference between a student just writing down an answer versus explaining how they got there step-by-step.\n\n\u2022 The researchers tested this on three big language models across different types of reasoning tasks \u2014 math problems, commonsense questions, and symbolic logic puzzles. The results were pretty impressive: just giving the model eight examples of step-by-step reasoning was enough to beat even specially fine-tuned models on tough math benchmarks.\n\n\u2022 Here's the kicker: this ability to reason through problems emerges naturally in large enough models \u2014 you don't need to retrain them or do anything fancy. You just show them a few examples of thinking out loud, and suddenly they can tackle problems they'd normally get wrong (like that cafeteria apple problem in the figure, which trips up standard prompting).\n\nSo basically, teaching AI to think step-by-step unlocks reasoning superpowers that were hiding in these big models all along!",
    "10-symbolic": "# 5 Symbolic Reasoning\n\n Time to see if these language models can play with symbols like we humans do! This section explores how chain-of-thought helps with tasks that are simple for us but tricky for AI.\n\n* The researchers tested two fun but challenging tasks: \"last letter concatenation\" (taking the last letter of each word in a name) and \"coin flip\" (tracking if a coin is heads-up after people flip or don't flip it).\n* For smaller language models, these tasks were nearly impossible without chain-of-thought prompting. But the 540B parameter PaLM model crushed it with almost 100% accuracy when using chain-of-thought.\n* Here's where it gets extra cool: they tested if models could handle longer examples than what they were trained on (like names with more words or more coin flips). Standard prompting completely failed, but chain-of-thought models could generalize to these longer examples!\n* The ability to manipulate abstract symbols only emerged in really big models (around 100B parameters) - showing that this kind of reasoning requires serious computational horsepower.\n\nSo basically, chain-of-thought prompting not only helps models solve symbolic puzzles but also helps them apply the same reasoning to more complex versions of those puzzles - kinda like teaching someone a method rather than just an answer.",
    "11-discussion": "# 6 Discussion\n\nAlright, time to wrap our brains around what this paper actually discovered! \n\n* Chain-of-thought prompting is like giving language models permission to \"show their work\" - and it dramatically improves their reasoning abilities across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic problems\n* The researchers didn't need to fine-tune or modify any models - they just changed how they asked questions by including examples that demonstrate step-by-step thinking\n* One of the coolest findings: for many tasks where bigger models didn't seem to help much before, adding chain-of-thought prompting suddenly made scaling matter again - bigger models got WAY better at reasoning\n\n* There are some limitations though: we still don't know if this is \"real reasoning\" like humans do, creating training data with reasoning chains could be expensive, the models can still make logical errors, and you need pretty large models for this to work well\n\nThis research basically shows we've been underestimating what large language models can do - we just weren't asking them questions the right way!",
    "12-related": "# 7 Related Work\n\n*Alright, time to see where this research fits in the academic family tree!*\n\n- This paper builds on two main research branches: (1) using step-by-step reasoning to solve problems and (2) the whole prompting revolution in language models\n- For step-by-step reasoning, they highlight Ling et al. (2017) as pioneers who used natural language explanations for math problems instead of formal computer languages. Cobbe et al. expanded this with bigger datasets, while Nye et al. showed similar benefits in programming tasks\n- On the prompting side, they acknowledge Brown et al.'s few-shot prompting work that started the trend, plus newer approaches like learned prompts and instruction-based prompting\n- What makes their work different? While others focused on improving the input side of prompts, these researchers are enhancing the output side by adding the chain of thought\n\nSo basically, they're standing on the shoulders of giants but taking a fresh angle by focusing on how language models explain their answers, not just how we ask the questions!",
    "13-conclusions": "# 8 Conclusions\n\n*Alright, time to wrap this science party up!*\n\n\u2022 Chain-of-thought prompting is basically a simple but powerful trick that helps large language models think step-by-step through complex problems - like giving them scratch paper for their digital brains.\n\n\u2022 The researchers discovered something super cool: this reasoning ability isn't programmed in but \"emerges\" naturally once language models get big enough. Before a certain size, models are pretty bad at reasoning, then - bam! - they suddenly get much better.\n\n\u2022 Their experiments showed this approach works across different types of thinking challenges: math problems, symbolic puzzles, and everyday common sense questions that previously had models scratching their digital heads.\n\n\u2022 This breakthrough opens doors for more language-based approaches to reasoning - potentially changing how we think about AI problem-solving without needing specialized architectures.\n\nSo basically, bigger language models + showing them how to \"show their work\" = surprisingly powerful reasoning abilities that weren't explicitly programmed!",
    "2-introduction": "# 1 Introduction\n\n  Large language models have been getting bigger and more powerful, but they still struggle with complex reasoning tasks like math problems and logical puzzles. Bigger doesn't automatically mean smarter at everything!\n\n* This paper combines two powerful ideas: (1) having models explain their reasoning step-by-step in natural language (like showing your work in math class), and (2) few-shot prompting, where you show the model a few examples of what you want it to do.\n\n* The researchers discovered something pretty amazing \u2014 when you give large language models a few examples that include the reasoning steps (not just question\u2192answer), they suddenly become much better at solving complex problems. No special training required!\n\n* The results are kind of mind-blowing: their PaLM 540B model with chain-of-thought prompting achieved record-breaking performance on math word problems, beating even specially fine-tuned models.\n\nThis approach is super practical because you don't need massive training datasets or separate models for each task \u2014 just a few well-crafted examples that show your thinking process!",
    "3-chain": "# 2 Chain-of-Thought Prompting\n\n It's like giving language models permission to \"think out loud\" before answering.\n\n* When humans tackle complex problems, we naturally break them down into steps. This paper shows that large language models can do this too if we simply show them a few examples of step-by-step reasoning.\n* Look at Figure 1 \u2014 the model that would've gotten the apple problem wrong suddenly gets it right when it works through the reasoning steps: \"23 apples - 20 used + 6 more = 9 apples.\"\n* This approach is super versatile! It works for math problems, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic tasks \u2014 basically anything humans can solve through language.\n* The beauty is in its simplicity: no special training needed! Just include examples of step-by-step reasoning in your prompts, and sufficiently large language models will follow the pattern.\n\nThis approach isn't just practical \u2014 it's also a window into how these models \"think,\" making it easier to understand when and why they make mistakes. The researchers will show this working across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning in the upcoming sections.",
    "4-arithmetic": "# 3 Arithmetic Reasoning\n\nTime to see how these language models handle math problems \u2014 and spoiler alert: it gets pretty impressive!\n\n* Math word problems (like the tennis ball example in Figure 1) are typically a struggle for language models, even though humans find them relatively simple\n* When researchers applied chain-of-thought prompting to the massive 540B parameter language model, something remarkable happened \u2014 it started performing as well as models specifically fine-tuned for math tasks\n* This wasn't just a small improvement \u2014 the model actually achieved new state-of-the-art results on GSM8K, which is a particularly challenging benchmark for math word problems\n* It's like watching a general-purpose student suddenly ace a specialized math test without any extra studying \u2014 just by being taught to \"show their work\"\n\nSo basically, getting these big language models to think step-by-step transformed their math abilities from \"meh\" to \"wow!\"",
    "5-experimental": "# 3.1 Experimental Setup\n\nAlright, science explorers \u2014 time to peek behind the curtain at how they actually tested this whole chain-of-thought idea!\n\n* They used **five different math problem datasets** (GSM8K, SVAMP, ASDiv, AQuA, and MAWPS) to see if their approach works across different types of math challenges. Think of it like testing a new skateboard trick on different ramps!\n\n* For the **baseline test** (standard prompting), they just showed the AI some example questions and answers, then asked for new answers directly \u2014 no explanation needed. Like asking \"What's 5+3?\" and expecting just \"8\" as the answer.\n\n* Their **new approach** (chain-of-thought prompting) included step-by-step reasoning with each example. Imagine showing someone not just the answer to a problem, but also your scratch work that explains how you got there!\n\n* They tested this on **five different AI models** (GPT-3, LaMDA, PaLM, UL2, and Codex) of various sizes to see if bigger brains = better reasoning. For most tests, they used the same eight examples across all the math problems to keep things consistent.\n\nSo basically, they set up a fair competition between \"just give me the answer\" prompting versus \"show your work\" prompting across different AIs and math problems!",
    "6-results": "# 3.2 Results\n\n**Time to see what happens when we let these big AI models think step-by-step!**\n\n* Chain-of-thought prompting is an \"emergent ability\" - it only starts working with REALLY big models (around 100 billion parameters). Smaller models write chains that sound good but are actually illogical, making them perform worse than standard prompting.\n\n* The harder the problem, the more chain-of-thought helps! For the toughest math problems (GSM8K), performance more than doubled with the largest models. But for super simple one-step math problems? Almost no improvement.\n\n* These big models with chain-of-thought prompting actually beat specialized fine-tuned systems! PaLM 540B set new records on several math benchmarks without any special training - just by \"thinking out loud.\"\n\nWhen researchers looked at what was happening under the hood, they found most errors came from either small calculation mistakes or bigger problems with understanding the question. Scaling up to larger models fixed many of these understanding errors - turns out bigger brains really do help with reasoning!",
    "7-ablation": "# 3.3 Ablation Study\n\nAlright, science detectives! This section is all about figuring out WHY chain-of-thought prompting works so well by testing different variations.\n\n* The researchers ran experiments to see if other prompting methods could match the performance of chain-of-thought. Spoiler alert: they couldn't!\n* They tried \"equation only\" prompting (just showing the math equation without reasoning steps), which flopped on complex problems. Turns out, jumping straight to equations without the natural language stepping stones is too hard for the model.\n* They tested if it was just about giving the model more tokens to \"think\" with by having it output meaningless dots. This performed the same as the baseline, showing it's not just about computation time - the actual reasoning in natural language matters!\n* They also tried putting the chain-of-thought AFTER the answer, which also didn't help. This confirms the model actually needs to work through the reasoning process step-by-step to get to the right answer.\n\nSo basically, the magic of chain-of-thought isn't just about more tokens or triggering knowledge - it's about the actual sequential reasoning process!",
    "8-robustness": "# 3.4 Robustness of Chain of Thought\n\nAlright, science friends \u2014 time to answer a super important question: does this whole chain-of-thought thing only work with perfectly crafted examples, or is it actually robust?\n\n* The researchers tested whether different people writing different chains of thought would still get good results. They had three different annotators (A, B, and C) write reasoning chains for the same math problems, including one version that was more concise.\n\n* Good news! While there was some variation in performance (which is normal for prompt-based approaches), ALL the different chain-of-thought styles significantly outperformed standard prompting. This means you don't need to be a \"reasoning chain perfectionist\" for this technique to work.\n\n* They also tried using completely different example problems (randomly sampled from a training dataset) and found similar strong results. Plus, they discovered it works regardless of the order of examples or how many examples you use.\n\nSo basically, chain-of-thought prompting is like that reliable friend who shows up no matter what \u2014 it works across different annotators, different example problems, different language models, and even when you shuffle things around!",
    "9-commonsense": "# 4 Commonsense Reasoning\n\nTime to see how this chain-of-thought magic works beyond just math problems! Turns out, it's pretty handy for helping AI understand everyday human logic too.\n\n* Chain-of-thought prompting isn't just for math \u2014 it works great for commonsense reasoning tasks where the AI needs to think about how the world works (like figuring out dates, understanding sports, or following instructions)\n* The researchers tested this approach on five different datasets that cover various types of common sense, from answering questions about the world to determining if sports scenarios make sense\n* The results? Pretty impressive! As they scaled up to bigger models (especially the massive PaLM 540B), the improvements got even more dramatic \u2014 in some cases, the AI even outperformed human experts!\n* One particularly cool achievement: their approach beat the previous record on StrategyQA (75.6% vs 69.4%) and even outscored sports enthusiasts on sports understanding questions (95.4% vs 84%)\n\nSo basically, giving AI these \"thinking steps\" helps it reason through everyday situations much like humans do \u2014 though interestingly, some tasks (like CSQA) didn't see huge improvements."
