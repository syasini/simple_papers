In particular, we demonstrate how\nspectral measurements of the low multipoles can be used to separate the motion-induced dipole\nof the CMB from a possible intrinsic dipole component. In a moving frame, the leakage of an\nintrinsic dipole moment into the CMB monopole and quadrupole induces spectral distortions with\ndistinct frequency functions that respectively peak at 337 GHz and 276 GHz. The leakage into the\nquadrupole moment also induces a geometrical distortion to the spatial morphology of this mode.\nThe combination of these effects can be used to lift the degeneracy between the motion-induced\ndipole and any intrinsic dipole that the CMB might possess. Assuming the current peculiar velocity\nmeasurements, the leakage of an intrinsic dipole with an amplitude of $\\Delta T = 30\\mu$K into the monopole\nand quadrupole moments will be detectable by a _PIXIE_\u2013like experiment at $\\sim 40$ nK (2.5$\\sigma$) and\n$\\sim 130$ nK (11$\\sigma$) level at their respective peak frequencies.\n\n*Introduction.* The measurements of the COBE/FIRAS\ninstrument show that the intensity of the Cosmic Mi-\ncrowave Background (CMB) has an almost perfect black-\nbody spectrum [1]. Even though in a frame moving with\nrespect to the CMB the observed intensity is effectively a\nblackbody in every direction, the intensity harmonic multi-\npoles in this frame generally contain frequency spectral\ndistortions. These distortions are a result of the leak-\nage of the nearby multipoles into each other due to the\naberration and Doppler effects [2\u20136]. The most promi-\nnent motion-induced leakage component is that of the\nmonopole into the dipole (i.e. kinematic dipole). The\nkinematic dipole has a frequency dependence identical to\na differential blackbody spectrum which makes it degen-\nerate with any intrinsic (or non-kinematic) dipole that\nthe CMB might possess. Current modeling of the CMB\ndipole only includes the leakage of the monopole, but\nignores any intrinsic dipole component as well as other\nkinematic corrections to this mode (e.g. the leakage of\nthe quadrupole). Here we present an accurate description\nof the frequency spectrum of the low multipoles of CMB\nand show how the kinematic (motion-induced) correc-\ntions to these modes can be used by the next generation\nof CMB surveys to lift the dipole degeneracy.\n\nA kinematic dipole is not the only observational con-\nsequence of our motion with respect to the CMB. The\nmotion-induced leakage of the intensity multipoles into\neach other causes a _boost coupling_ between the nearby\nmultipoles. Measuring this boost coupling in a wide\nrange of harmonic modes can actually lead to an inde-\npendent measure of the peculiar velocity of an observer\n\nwith respect to the CMB [7\u201310]. In the CMB rest frame,\nall motion-induced effects (including the kinematic dipole\nand the boost coupling) vanish; however, there is no com-\npelling reason for us to believe that the intrinsic dipole\nmoment of the CMB in this frame is precisely zero.\n\nIt has been shown that in a flat \u039bCDM universe with\nadiabatic initial perturbations, the intrinsic dipole of the\nCMB is strongly suppressed [11, 12]. For this reason,\nthe intrinsic dipole of the CMB is usually either ignored\nor set to zero, and the observed dipole of the CMB is\ninterpreted entirely as a kinematic effect. This results\nin a peculiar velocity of $\\beta \\equiv v/c = 0.00123$ in the di-\nrection $\\hat{\\beta} = (264^\\circ, 48^\\circ)$ in galactic coordinates [13]. If\nthe observed dipole moment only has a kinematic ori-\ngin, it can be used to define a natural rest frame for\nCMB (namely, the frame in which the whole dipole van-\nishes). However, unintended subtraction of an existent\nnon-kinematic dipole in this process will result in ob-\ntaining an incorrect CMB rest frame. This can in turn\nlead to unexpected anomalies, such as the observed power\nand parity asymmetries in the CMB [14, 15] and the mis-\nmatch between the CMB rest frame and the matter rest\nframe [16\u201319]. Studying the angular variance of the Hubble\nparameter over different redshifts (in the CMB dipole-\ninferred frame) also indicates the presence of a non-\nkinematic dipole component in the CMB [20, 21]. Fur-\nthermore, since isocurvature initial perturbations, and\nmulti-field inflationary scenarios typically invoke a non-\nnegligible intrinsic dipole moment, a detection of this\ncomponent could have important implications for pre-\nrecombination physics [22\u201326].\n\nRecently the Planck team has obtained an independent\nvalue for the peculiar velocity of the solar system using\nthe boost coupling of the CMB multipoles. Their result\n$\\beta = 0.00128 \\pm 0.00026$ (stat.) $\\pm 0.00038$ (syst.) [7] is consis-\n\ntent with the kinematic interpretation of the dipole and\nshows that most of the dipole that we observe is induced\nby our peculiar motion. However, the error bars still al-\nlow for a non-kinematic dipole component that remains\nto be measured.\n\nIn this letter we show how the kinematic and non-\nkinematic dipoles can be separated by measuring the\nmotion-induced spectral distortions in the observed low\nmultipoles of the CMB in our local frame. Future mi-\ncrowave surveys, such as _PIXIE_ with a sensitivity of\n5 Jy/sr, will be able to measure these effects with high\nprecision.\n\n*Lorentz boosting the CMB.* We define the rest frame of the CMB as the frame in which its kinematic dipole (the leakage of the monopole into the dipole) vanishes.\\textsuperscript{1} We still allow the CMB to have a non-kinematic dipole in this frame. Then we argue that the full frequency spectrum of the low intensity multipoles in the boosted frame can be exploited to separate the intrinsic dipole from the kinematic part induced by a boost. We assume that the CMB frequency spectrum in its rest frame can be described as a pure blackbody by neglecting any pre-recombination and secondary $\\mu$- and $y$-distortions (see Fig. 12 in [27], also [28]). In this frame, we expand the intensity and the thermodynamic temperature in spherical harmonic multipoles as\n\n$ I_{\\nu_{cmb}}(\\hat{\\gamma}_{cmb}) = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m}^{\\ell} a_{\\ell m}^{I_{cmb}}(\\nu_{cmb})\\, Y_{\\ell m}(\\hat{\\gamma}_{cmb}) \\qquad (1) $\n\nand\n\n$T(\\hat{\\gamma}_{cmb}) = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{m}^{\\ell} a_{\\ell m}^{T^{cmb}} Y_{\\ell m}(\\hat{\\gamma}_{cmb}), \\tag{2}$\n\nwhere the sum notation $\\sum_{m}^{\\ell}$ is shorthand for $\\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell}$.

Even though in a frame moving with\nrespect to the CMB the observed intensity is effectively a\nblackbody in every direction, the intensity harmonic multi-\npoles in this frame generally contain frequency spectral\ndistortions. These distortions are a result of the leak-\nage of the nearby multipoles into each other due to the\naberration and Doppler effects [2\u20136]. The most promi-\nnent motion-induced leakage component is that of the\nmonopole into the dipole (i.e. kinematic dipole). The\nkinematic dipole has a frequency dependence identical to\na differential blackbody spectrum which makes it degen-\nerate with any intrinsic (or non-kinematic) dipole that\nthe CMB might possess. Current modeling of the CMB\ndipole only includes the leakage of the monopole, but\nignores any intrinsic dipole component as well as other\nkinematic corrections to this mode (e.g. the leakage of\nthe quadrupole).

The\nmotion-induced leakage of the intensity multipoles into\neach other causes a _boost coupling_ between the nearby\nmultipoles. Measuring this boost coupling in a wide\nrange of harmonic modes can actually lead to an inde-\npendent measure of the peculiar velocity of an observer\n\nwith respect to the CMB [7\u201310]. In the CMB rest frame,\nall motion-induced effects (including the kinematic dipole\nand the boost coupling) vanish; however, there is no com-\npelling reason for us to believe that the intrinsic dipole\nmoment of the CMB in this frame is precisely zero.\n\nIt has been shown that in a flat \u039bCDM universe with\nadiabatic initial perturbations, the intrinsic dipole of the\nCMB is strongly suppressed [11, 12]. For this reason,\nthe intrinsic dipole of the CMB is usually either ignored\nor set to zero, and the observed dipole of the CMB is\ninterpreted entirely as a kinematic effect. This results\nin a peculiar velocity of $\\beta \\equiv v/c = 0.00123$ in the di-\nrection $\\hat{\\beta} = (264^\\circ, 48^\\circ)$ in galactic coordinates [13].

However, unintended subtraction of an existent\nnon-kinematic dipole in this process will result in ob-\ntaining an incorrect CMB rest frame. This can in turn\nlead to unexpected anomalies, such as the observed power\nand parity asymmetries in the CMB [14, 15] and the mis-\nmatch between the CMB rest frame and the matter rest\nframe [16\u201319]. Studying the angular variance of the Hubble\nparameter over different redshifts (in the CMB dipole-\ninferred frame) also indicates the presence of a non-\nkinematic dipole component in the CMB [20, 21].

In a moving frame, the leakage of an\nintrinsic dipole moment into the CMB monopole and quadrupole induces spectral distortions with\ndistinct frequency functions that respectively peak at 337 GHz and 276 GHz. The leakage into the\nquadrupole moment also induces a geometrical distortion to the spatial morphology of this mode.\nThe combination of these effects can be used to lift the degeneracy between the motion-induced\ndipole and any intrinsic dipole that the CMB might possess. Assuming the current peculiar velocity\nmeasurements, the leakage of an intrinsic dipole with an amplitude of $\\Delta T = 30\\mu$K into the monopole\nand quadrupole moments will be detectable by a _PIXIE_\u2013like experiment at $\\sim 40$ nK (2.5$\\sigma$) and\n$\\sim 130$ nK (11$\\sigma$) level at their respective peak frequencies.\n\n*Introduction.* The measurements of the COBE/FIRAS\ninstrument show that the intensity of the Cosmic Mi-\ncrowave Background (CMB) has an almost perfect black-\nbody spectrum [1]. Even though in a frame moving with\nrespect to the CMB the observed intensity is effectively a\nblackbody in every direction, the intensity harmonic multi-\npoles in this frame generally contain frequency spectral\ndistortions. These distortions are a result of the leak-\nage of the nearby multipoles into each other due to the\naberration and Doppler effects [2\u20136]. The most promi-\nnent motion-induced leakage component is that of the\nmonopole into the dipole (i.e. kinematic dipole). The\nkinematic dipole has a frequency dependence identical to\na differential blackbody spectrum which makes it degen-\nerate with any intrinsic (or non-kinematic) dipole that\nthe CMB might possess. Current modeling of the CMB\ndipole only includes the leakage of the monopole, but\nignores any intrinsic dipole component as well as other\nkinematic corrections to this mode (e.g. the leakage of\nthe quadrupole). Here we present an accurate description\nof the frequency spectrum of the low multipoles of CMB\nand show how the kinematic (motion-induced) correc-\ntions to these modes can be used by the next generation\nof CMB surveys to lift the dipole degeneracy.\n\nA kinematic dipole is not the only observational con-\nsequence of our motion with respect to the CMB. The\nmotion-induced leakage of the intensity multipoles into\neach other causes a _boost coupling_ between the nearby\nmultipoles. Measuring this boost coupling in a wide\nrange of harmonic modes can actually lead to an inde-\npendent measure of the peculiar velocity of an observer\n\nwith respect to the CMB [7\u201310]. In the CMB rest frame,\nall motion-induced effects (including the kinematic dipole\nand the boost coupling) vanish; however, there is no com-\npelling reason for us to believe that the intrinsic dipole\nmoment of the CMB in this frame is precisely zero.\n\nIt has been shown that in a flat \u039bCDM universe with\nadiabatic initial perturbations, the intrinsic dipole of the\nCMB is strongly suppressed [11, 12]. For this reason,\nthe intrinsic dipole of the CMB is usually either ignored\nor set to zero, and the observed dipole of the CMB is\ninterpreted entirely as a kinematic effect. This results\nin a peculiar velocity of $\\beta \\equiv v/c = 0.00123$ in the di-\nrection $\\hat{\\beta} = (264^\\circ, 48^\\circ)$ in galactic coordinates [13]. If\nthe observed dipole moment only has a kinematic ori-\ngin, it can be used to define a natural rest frame for\nCMB (namely, the frame in which the whole dipole van-\nishes). However, unintended subtraction of an existent\nnon-kinematic dipole in this process will result in ob-\ntaining an incorrect CMB rest frame. This can in turn\nlead to unexpected anomalies, such as the observed power\nand parity asymmetries in the CMB [14, 15] and the mis-\nmatch between the CMB rest frame and the matter rest\nframe [16\u201319]. Studying the angular variance of the Hubble\nparameter over different redshifts (in the CMB dipole-\ninferred frame) also indicates the presence of a non-\nkinematic dipole component in the CMB [20, 21]. Fur-\nthermore, since isocurvature initial perturbations, and\nmulti-field inflationary scenarios typically invoke a non-\nnegligible intrinsic dipole moment, a detection of this\ncomponent could have important implications for pre-\nrecombination physics [22\u201326].\n\nRecently the Planck team has obtained an independent\nvalue for the peculiar velocity of the solar system using\nthe boost coupling of the CMB multipoles. Their result\n$\\beta = 0.00128 \\pm 0.00026$ (stat.) $\\pm 0.00038$ (syst.)

The leakage into the\nquadrupole moment also induces a geometrical distortion to the spatial morphology of this mode.\nThe combination of these effects can be used to lift the degeneracy between the motion-induced\ndipole and any intrinsic dipole that the CMB might possess. Assuming the current peculiar velocity\nmeasurements, the leakage of an intrinsic dipole with an amplitude of $\\Delta T = 30\\mu$K into the monopole\nand quadrupole moments will be detectable by a _PIXIE_\u2013like experiment at $\\sim 40$ nK (2.5$\\sigma$) and\n$\\sim 130$ nK (11$\\sigma$) level at their respective peak frequencies.\n\n*Introduction.* The measurements of the COBE/FIRAS\ninstrument show that the intensity of the Cosmic Mi-\ncrowave Background (CMB) has an almost perfect black-\nbody spectrum [1]. Even though in a frame moving with\nrespect to the CMB the observed intensity is effectively a\nblackbody in every direction, the intensity harmonic multi-\npoles in this frame generally contain frequency spectral\ndistortions. These distortions are a result of the leak-\nage of the nearby multipoles into each other due to the\naberration and Doppler effects [2\u20136]. The most promi-\nnent motion-induced leakage component is that of the\nmonopole into the dipole (i.e. kinematic dipole). The\nkinematic dipole has a frequency dependence identical to\na differential blackbody spectrum which makes it degen-\nerate with any intrinsic (or non-kinematic) dipole that\nthe CMB might possess. Current modeling of the CMB\ndipole only includes the leakage of the monopole, but\nignores any intrinsic dipole component as well as other\nkinematic corrections to this mode (e.g. the leakage of\nthe quadrupole). Here we present an accurate description\nof the frequency spectrum of the low multipoles of CMB\nand show how the kinematic (motion-induced) correc-\ntions to these modes can be used by the next generation\nof CMB surveys to lift the dipole degeneracy.\n\nA kinematic dipole is not the only observational con-\nsequence of our motion with respect to the CMB. The\nmotion-induced leakage of the intensity multipoles into\neach other causes a _boost coupling_ between the nearby\nmultipoles. Measuring this boost coupling in a wide\nrange of harmonic modes can actually lead to an inde-\npendent measure of the peculiar velocity of an observer\n\nwith respect to the CMB [7\u201310]. In the CMB rest frame,\nall motion-induced effects (including the kinematic dipole\nand the boost coupling) vanish; however, there is no com-\npelling reason for us to believe that the intrinsic dipole\nmoment of the CMB in this frame is precisely zero.\n\nIt has been shown that in a flat \u039bCDM universe with\nadiabatic initial perturbations, the intrinsic dipole of the\nCMB is strongly suppressed [11, 12]. For this reason,\nthe intrinsic dipole of the CMB is usually either ignored\nor set to zero, and the observed dipole of the CMB is\ninterpreted entirely as a kinematic effect. This results\nin a peculiar velocity of $\\beta \\equiv v/c = 0.00123$ in the di-\nrection $\\hat{\\beta} = (264^\\circ, 48^\\circ)$ in galactic coordinates [13]. If\nthe observed dipole moment only has a kinematic ori-\ngin, it can be used to define a natural rest frame for\nCMB (namely, the frame in which the whole dipole van-\nishes). However, unintended subtraction of an existent\nnon-kinematic dipole in this process will result in ob-\ntaining an incorrect CMB rest frame. This can in turn\nlead to unexpected anomalies, such as the observed power\nand parity asymmetries in the CMB [14, 15] and the mis-\nmatch between the CMB rest frame and the matter rest\nframe [16\u201319]. Studying the angular variance of the Hubble\nparameter over different redshifts (in the CMB dipole-\ninferred frame) also indicates the presence of a non-\nkinematic dipole component in the CMB [20, 21]. Fur-\nthermore, since isocurvature initial perturbations, and\nmulti-field inflationary scenarios typically invoke a non-\nnegligible intrinsic dipole moment, a detection of this\ncomponent could have important implications for pre-\nrecombination physics [22\u201326].\n\nRecently the Planck team has obtained an independent\nvalue for the peculiar velocity of the solar system using\nthe boost coupling of the CMB multipoles.

The\nmotion-induced leakage of the intensity multipoles into\neach other causes a _boost coupling_ between the nearby\nmultipoles. Measuring this boost coupling in a wide\nrange of harmonic modes can actually lead to an inde-\npendent measure of the peculiar velocity of an observer\n\nwith respect to the CMB [7\u201310]. In the CMB rest frame,\nall motion-induced effects (including the kinematic dipole\nand the boost coupling) vanish; however, there is no com-\npelling reason for us to believe that the intrinsic dipole\nmoment of the CMB in this frame is precisely zero.\n\nIt has been shown that in a flat \u039bCDM universe with\nadiabatic initial perturbations, the intrinsic dipole of the\nCMB is strongly suppressed [11, 12]. For this reason,\nthe intrinsic dipole of the CMB is usually either ignored\nor set to zero, and the observed dipole of the CMB is\ninterpreted entirely as a kinematic effect. This results\nin a peculiar velocity of $\\beta \\equiv v/c = 0.00123$ in the di-\nrection $\\hat{\\beta} = (264^\\circ, 48^\\circ)$ in galactic coordinates [13]. If\nthe observed dipole moment only has a kinematic ori-\ngin, it can be used to define a natural rest frame for\nCMB (namely, the frame in which the whole dipole van-\nishes).

This can in turn\nlead to unexpected anomalies, such as the observed power\nand parity asymmetries in the CMB [14, 15] and the mis-\nmatch between the CMB rest frame and the matter rest\nframe [16\u201319]. Studying the angular variance of the Hubble\nparameter over different redshifts (in the CMB dipole-\ninferred frame) also indicates the presence of a non-\nkinematic dipole component in the CMB [20, 21].

In particular, we demonstrate how\nspectral measurements of the low multipoles can be used to separate the motion-induced dipole\nof the CMB from a possible intrinsic dipole component. In a moving frame, the leakage of an\nintrinsic dipole moment into the CMB monopole and quadrupole induces spectral distortions with\ndistinct frequency functions that respectively peak at 337 GHz and 276 GHz. The leakage into the\nquadrupole moment also induces a geometrical distortion to the spatial morphology of this mode.\nThe combination of these effects can be used to lift the degeneracy between the motion-induced\ndipole and any intrinsic dipole that the CMB might possess. Assuming the current peculiar velocity\nmeasurements, the leakage of an intrinsic dipole with an amplitude of $\\Delta T = 30\\mu$K into the monopole\nand quadrupole moments will be detectable by a _PIXIE_\u2013like experiment at $\\sim 40$ nK (2.5$\\sigma$) and\n$\\sim 130$ nK (11$\\sigma$) level at their respective peak frequencies.\n\n*Introduction.* The measurements of the COBE/FIRAS\ninstrument show that the intensity of the Cosmic Mi-\ncrowave Background (CMB) has an almost perfect black-\nbody spectrum [1]. Even though in a frame moving with\nrespect to the CMB the observed intensity is effectively a\nblackbody in every direction, the intensity harmonic multi-\npoles in this frame generally contain frequency spectral\ndistortions. These distortions are a result of the leak-\nage of the nearby multipoles into each other due to the\naberration and Doppler effects [2\u20136]. The most promi-\nnent motion-induced leakage component is that of the\nmonopole into the dipole (i.e. kinematic dipole). The\nkinematic dipole has a frequency dependence identical to\na differential blackbody spectrum which makes it degen-\nerate with any intrinsic (or non-kinematic) dipole that\nthe CMB might possess. Current modeling of the CMB\ndipole only includes the leakage of the monopole, but\nignores any intrinsic dipole component as well as other\nkinematic corrections to this mode (e.g. the leakage of\nthe quadrupole). Here we present an accurate description\nof the frequency spectrum of the low multipoles of CMB\nand show how the kinematic (motion-induced) correc-\ntions to these modes can be used by the next generation\nof CMB surveys to lift the dipole degeneracy.\n\nA kinematic dipole is not the only observational con-\nsequence of our motion with respect to the CMB. The\nmotion-induced leakage of the intensity multipoles into\neach other causes a _boost coupling_ between the nearby\nmultipoles. Measuring this boost coupling in a wide\nrange of harmonic modes can actually lead to an inde-\npendent measure of the peculiar velocity of an observer\n\nwith respect to the CMB [7\u201310]. In the CMB rest frame,\nall motion-induced effects (including the kinematic dipole\nand the boost coupling) vanish; however, there is no com-\npelling reason for us to believe that the intrinsic dipole\nmoment of the CMB in this frame is precisely zero.\n\nIt has been shown that in a flat \u039bCDM universe with\nadiabatic initial perturbations, the intrinsic dipole of the\nCMB is strongly suppressed [11, 12]. For this reason,\nthe intrinsic dipole of the CMB is usually either ignored\nor set to zero, and the observed dipole of the CMB is\ninterpreted entirely as a kinematic effect. This results\nin a peculiar velocity of $\\beta \\equiv v/c = 0.00123$ in the di-\nrection $\\hat{\\beta} = (264^\\circ, 48^\\circ)$ in galactic coordinates [13].

Unless the intrinsic  \ndipole is much larger than the one we chose, the domi-  \nnant term in this equation is the leakage of the mono-  \npole into the dipole (kinematic dipole) with the thermo-  \nnamic temperature $\\delta T^{(1)} \\equiv \\delta I_{\\nu}^{(1)}/\\tilde{F}_{\\nu}(T_0) = 3.35$ mK.  \nThe next order contribution is due to the intrinsic dipole  \nwith the same frequency function as that of the kine-  \nmatic dipole. The leakage of the quadrupole into the  \ndipole is a motion-induced effect which does not depend  \non the intrinsic dipole at all. Since this term has a dif-  \nferent frequency dependence, technically it could be used  \nas an independent measure of $\\beta$. However, the peak am-  \nplitude of this component\u2014assuming the observed value  \nof the quadrupole as input\u2014is lower than the sensitiv-  \nity of PIXIE, and therefore it is not likely to be useful  \nfor lifting the dipole degeneracy. Nevertheless, this ex-  \ntra leakage component should be taken into account for a  \nprecise analysis of the observed dipole in the future CMB  \nsurveys.\n\nNow we show how the dipole degeneracy can be removed by looking at the motion induced spectral distortions in the dipole\u2019s neighbors: the monopole ($\\ell' = 0$) and the quadrupole ($\\ell' = 2$).\n\n*The boosted monopole.* Using Eq. (7), it is easy to find the monopole of the CMB in a boosted frame (Eq. B.36 in Ref. [2])\n\n$ a_{00}^{I}(\\nu) = \\tilde{B}_\\nu(T_0) a_{00}^{\\mathrm{Tcmb}} + \\beta^2 \\tilde{B}_\\nu^{(20)}(T_0) a_{00}^{\\mathrm{Tcmb}} \\\\\n\\quad + \\beta \\sum_{m}^{1} \\frac{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}{3} Y_{1m}(\\hat{\\beta}) \\tilde{F}_\\nu^{(11)}(T_0) a_{1m}^{\\mathrm{Tcmb}} \\tag{10} \\\\\n\\quad - \\beta \\sum_{m}^{1} \\frac{4\\sqrt{\\pi}}{3} Y_{1m}(\\hat{\\beta}) \\tilde{F}_\\nu(T_0) a_{1m}^{\\mathrm{Tcmb}} + O(\\beta^2), $\n\nwith $\\tilde{B}_{\\nu}^{(20)}(T_0) = \\frac{1}{6} \\tilde{F}_{\\nu}(T)(g(x)-3)$.
