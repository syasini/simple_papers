Coming in hot from the quantum frontier, it's the paper that's sending shockwaves through the cryptography world! *\"HOW TO FACTOR 2048 BIT RSA INTEGERS WITH LESS THAN A MILLION NOISY QUBITS!\"* That's right, folks! The encryption-crushing, quantum-computing MASTERPIECE brought to you by none other than the BRILLIANT, the REVOLUTIONARY, the QUANTUM WIZARD himself \u2013 CRAIG GIDNEY of Google Quantum AI! Buckle up, security experts! This isn't just a paper, it's a QUANTUM EARTHQUAKE that's redefining what's possible with fewer qubits than EVER BEFORE! The cryptography game will NEVER be the same! Let's give it up for Craig Gidney, folks \u2013 the quantum champion changing the FUTURE of factorization!",
    "1-results": "# Results\n\nUmm so basically... this is where the paper would normally show what they found out from all their science-ing! \n\n\u2022 This section appears to be empty or missing content - there's just a header labeled \"3 Results\" but no actual text\n\u2022 Results sections typically contain the data, measurements, observations, and findings from the experiments or research\n\u2022 This is usually where you'd find charts, graphs, statistics, and explanations of what the researchers discovered\n\u2022 Without the actual content, I can't tell you what they found or how it relates to their research questions\n\nImagine explaining this to your dog: \"See this blank space? That's where all the exciting discoveries should be, but someone forgot to include them!\" We'll need the actual content to understand what the researchers discovered."
